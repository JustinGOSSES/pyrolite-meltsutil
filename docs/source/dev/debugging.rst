Debugging
------------

This section contains some tips for debugging issues and common errors associated with
:mod:`pyrolite-meltsutil`. Note that the scope of these suggestions is necessarily limited,
and specific issues which relate more to :mod:`matplotlib.pyplot`, :mod:`pandas`,
and :mod:`numpy` are often well documented elsewhere online.

Questions
-----------

Followed the above guidelines and still stuck? The maintainers are happy to answer
questions and help you solve small bugs. It's useful to know where people get stuck
so we can modify things where useful, and this is an easy way to contribute to the
project.

If you have an issue which you think others may also run into, consider posting a
question on `stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__ for visibility.


Reporting
-----------

Followed the debugging guidelines, checked out some of the previous questions and
still can't solve the issue? Think it's a bug or problem with :mod:`pyrolite` or
:mod:`pyrolite-meltsutil` specifically?
Some guidelines for reporting issues and bugs are given below.
